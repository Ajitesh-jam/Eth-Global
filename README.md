We have tried using stackr Labs to keep track of user skins in layer 2 (Vulcan) but we were unable to do so in limited time. We were unable to call post requests the actions and transitions in the playground via unity to update the state of blockchain which eventually led to dismissal of the approach.

Current Progress:

- Created Custome State machine.
- Successfully intilaised and deployed a state machine in Layer 2 (Appid: 105 and 112)
